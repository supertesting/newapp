# Puppet Labs SSH Keys #

Puppet Labs engineers and technical people should add their SSH public keys to
the templates directory of this project.

These keys are periodically copied to the Jenkins CI systems which are not
managed by Puppet.

# Usage #

If a host is not being managed by Puppet, then SSH access can be granted using
this process.

If the host has a cron that uses /etc/cron.hourly/ then simply copy the script into /etc/cron.hourly/ like this:

    cd /etc/cron.hourly/
    curl -O https://raw.github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-sshkeys/master/templates/scripts/manage_root_authorized_keys
    chmod +x manage_root_authorized_keys

If the cron on the system does not support cron.hourly, the following crontab
entry may be used.

    mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
    cd /usr/local/bin
    curl -O https://raw.github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-sshkeys/master/templates/scripts/manage_root_authorized_keys
    chmod +x manage_root_authorized_keys
    crontab -e

The entry should look like:

    # min hour dom month dow command
    59 * * * * /usr/local/bin/manage_root_authorized_keys

# Adding Keys #

Ideally, keys should be registered in the [User Account
Registry](https://docs.google.com/a/puppetlabs.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=en_US&formkey=dGl5YVFEX3R6a3p2Vm5wMlRkNDZaVWc6MQ#gid=2)
and then added to the templates/ssh/ directory of this repository, as username.pub and added to the authorized\_keys file too.
Once merged into the master branch, the keys will automatically be
copied to all of the hosts using this script.
